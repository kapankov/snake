# The Snake game for the terminal

The game is implemented on Free Pascal and is:
- cross-platform (tested on Ubuntu Linux 24.04 and Windows 11)
- does not use Crt modules (A number of functions from Crt are not implemented or work crookedly in Free Pascal. For example, CursorOff, CursorOn.), Keyboard, etc.
